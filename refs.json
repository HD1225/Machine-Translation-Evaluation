course, in the specified case we did not exactly re-rub in order to uncover the coiled dimension wrapping the thickness of the hose.", "It was enough to pick up a telescope for help.", "But if the hose were thinner, like a piece of hair or a capillary, we could uncover the coiled dimension only with great effort.", "In 1919, Kaluza sent Einstein his article, in which he toiled with a huge thought, that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three of the dimensions that we know.", "Kaluza explained his radical claim by pointing out that an additional dimension provides an elegant and convincing framework, in which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory could be combined into one unified concept.", "This immediately gives rise the question of how this discovery by Kaluza goes together with the obvious fact that we see three dimensions of space.", "The answer that Kaluza predicted quietly between the lines, and which was clearly expressed and clarified by Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, rests and falls with the claim that the spatial geometry of our universe could have both large and coiled dimensions.", "That means that just like the dimension in the direction of the length of the hose, our universe too has a large, extensive and easily visible set of three dimensions, the existence of which we realize at every moment.", "But analogically to the circumference of a garden hose, the universe too can have additional dimensions, firmly coiled into space with it not obvious that until now they have remained hidden even from our most perfect experimental apparatuses.", "In order to get a clearer idea of the basis of Kaluza's noteworthy proposal, let's continue focusing on that hose for a while.", "Imagine that on the circumference of the hose we draw a relatively thick row of rings in black color.", "From a distance, the hose still appears as a thin one-dimensional line.", "Now with a telescope, thanks to drawing, we can uncover a coiled dimension even more easily, as shown in figure 2.", "We can clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension that is large and almost unlimited, and with another short one and a ring.", "Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but besides one small circular dimension it has three large spatial dimensions, meaning together four spatial dimensions.", "It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.", "In order to help our imagination a little, we should notice the

surface of the hose.", "Each of the following levels represents a major enlargement of the geometry of the space from the previous level.", "Our universe can have additional dimensions (we see them in the fourth level of enlargement), if they are coiled into a sufficiently small space; this is how we explain that we have not observed them directly so far.", "The grid illustrates the well known \"large\" dimension, while the ring illustrates the new, small and coiled dimension.", "Just like loops of thread in a thick carpet, these rings too exist in every place with usual dimensions, but for illustration we have sketched them only in interwoven patterns in a grid.", "The background of figure 4 illustrates the well known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - in typical measuring units, such as meters, illustrated with the side of a small square in a grid.", "On each subsequent image, we will focus on the small area of the previous image; we will enlarge it so that it becomes visible.", "From the beginning, nothing special happens, as we can see in several of the first levels of enlargement.", "But when we move further along our path to discover the microscopic properties of the geometry of space - to the fourth level of enlargement in figure 3 - then we will suddenly encounter a new dimension coiled in a ring shape, similar to loops of thread in a thick piece woven piece of carpet.", "Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circular dimension exists in every place in the direction of large dimensions similar to that of circumference of a hose along each point of its length.", "For illustrative purposes, we have drawn the circular dimension only in certain regularly placed points.", "Figure 4 summarizes Kaluza's and Klein's idea about the microscopic structure of geometry of space.", "The similarity to the hose is obvious, but we can even notice some important differences.", "First, the universe has three large spatial dimensions far sprawling from each other (of which we have drawn only two), and only hose has a large dimension.", "An even more important difference is that now we are talking about spatial geometry of the universe itself, not about any object within the universe, such as our hose.", "But the basic idea is the same.", "If the additional circularly coiled dimension is extremely miniature, it can be recognized, just like the round circumference of the host, much more difficultly than observing obvious, large and extensive dimensions.", "If the size of an additional dimension is sufficiently small, uncovering it will in fact be beyond the capabilities of our most modern enlargement tools.", "However, the most important thing is that the additional dimension is not a mere round protuberance inside regular dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration erroneously indicates.", "The circular dimension is a new dimension, which exists in every point of three regular extensive dimensions.", "It is a dimension that is independent of the remaining three dimensions, just as the top-bottom, left-right and front-back dimensions are mutually independent (and diagonal).", "A small enough ant could move in all four dimensions, and in order to determine its position we would need four pieces of information, besides the three usual details also the position in the circular dimension; if we figure in time as well, then there are five details, but in any case it there is one more than we would normally expect.", "Did this interest you?", "You can purchase the book \"The Elegant Universe\" by Brian Greene at knihy.idnes.cz.", "The price of the e-book version is CZK 149.", "Much to our surprise, we are finding out that although we are aware of the existence of only

government to negotiate with the pro-Russia insurgents as equals corresponded with the apparent strategy he has followed since the violence began five months ago: Help the separatists take territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly proclaimed Novorossiya region virtual independence to align with Russia instead of the West.", "In an interview with state-run Channel One television, Putin denounced the Ukrainian military campaign to recover separatist-held territory in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions that were seized in March and April, after Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula on March 18.", "The Kremlin and the separatists have lately branded the seized territory \"Novorossiya,\" or \"New Russia,\" a term that harkens to pre-revolutionary glory

spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin didn't mean to imply that the eastern Ukrainian territory under separatist control would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine had to be revised to give the Russian-speaking region the power to protect its rights and interests.", "But Putin's call upon the Kiev government to negotiate with the pro-Russia insurgents as equals

between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict.\"", "The Kremlin spokesman's intercession to correct the \"misinterpretation\" of Putin's remarks underscored the Russian leadership's approach to dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east differently from its outright seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million population is ethnic Russian.", "Moscow would have a much more difficult fight to annex even the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russian and pre-conflict polls showed broad support for staying

control would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine had to be revised to give the Russian-speaking region the power to protect its rights and interests.", "But Putin's call upon the Kiev government to negotiate with the pro-Russia insurgents as equals corresponded with the apparent strategy he has followed since the violence began five months ago: Help the separatists take territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly proclaimed Novorossiya region virtual independence to align with Russia instead of the West.", "In an interview with state-run Channel

correct the \"misinterpretation\" of Putin's remarks underscored the Russian leadership's approach to dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east differently from its outright seizure of Crimea,

rights.", "When this country counseled other countries on how to forge civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize a trade union - and to have that trade union engage in collective bargaining as an equal partner with corporations and government agencies - had to be protected.", "Now, with those rights under assault in America, it is wise, indeed, to recommit to the American ideal that working people must have a right to organize and to make their voices heard in a free and open society.", "As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:",

"The measure, signed into law by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June and due to take effect Sept. 1, would require doctors who perform abortions to have patient admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.", "However, the judge's ruling means that for the time being doctors can continue to perform legal abortions while seeking such privileges.", "\"Plaintiffs will be allowed to operate lawfully while continuing their efforts to obtain privileges,\" Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in the decision.", "A hearing will be scheduled within a month for the judge to make a more permanent ruling on the law.", "Abortion rights activists applauded the decision, the latest in a string of rulings against similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to seek

the two clinics who were not plaintiffs in the suit and have also applied for admitting privileges.", "Louisiana is among 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts recently ruling unconstitutional such measures in Alabama and Mississippi.", "Key parts of a Texas law that would have shuttered most remaining clinics in that state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.",

code, by decreasing the VAT rate to 10% upon the sale of goods produced in Russia.", "The idea to introduce a 50% quota in retail chain stores is part of a package of stimulus measures for Russian producers.", "The amount of domestic goods that will appear on store shelves will increase severalfold.", "However, the initiative may have both a positive and negative effect, experts say.", "According to Sergei Litvinenko, lawyer for the company, Nalogovik, and a member of Public Duma, an independent expert centre, the effect on the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and the food industries, will be positive and will lead to growth.", "Agricultural producers, farmers, and small stores stand to gain.", "They will be able to sell more, and that means that their profits will increase.", "Furthermore, they will receive the right to dictate their prices and conditions to retailers, since retailers will be obliged to buy their goods.", "Russian producers will be able to increase the scope of their operations and the volume of their sales, which will result in the payment of higher taxes than before.", "This will increase fiscal revenues and create new jobs, certain industries will start to expand, some will find their feet faster than others, and it will contribute to GDP growth.", "Russia\u2019s dependence on foreign foodstuffs will decline severalfold, but, of course, not immediately\u201d, the expert notes.", "Previously, Russian businesses were frequently unable to get their goods onto the shelves of local stores as a result of the high level of competition from foreign competitors.", "Now, after the introduction of the embargo, this niche has been freed up and it\u2019s possible to breathe a little more easily.", "But it shouldn\u2019t be forgotten that, after all of the necessary agreements and sanitary inspections have been completed, food commodities produced in Latin America, Turkey, and Serbia will hit the Russian market.", "In other words, a \"moment of calm\" is at hand, when the previous players have already left, and the new ones haven\u2019t yet arrived.", "After almost a month, it is possible to talk about an increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as higher prices on finished products\u201d, Tamara Kasyanova (PhD Econ.), First Vice-President of the All-Russian Public Organization, Russian Club of Financial Directors, told AiF.ru.", "Without a doubt, the idea of selling a minimum of 50% of Russian food products in every category will make it possible to secure this sector for local producers.", "In this case, they will be competing with each other, and not with goods that cost less as a result of subsidies from a different state.", "In other words, competition for consumers will take place between companies that are doing business according to the same industry laws.", "On the other hand, Kasyanova notes, Russian producers are far from being able to meet 50% of the domestic needs of their compatriots in all respects.", "And in a situation like this, retail chain stores will have to \u201cstrive\u201d to ensure that at least half of their product assortment is comprised of Russian goods.", "Accordingly, there is a growing fear that poor quality products will find their way onto store shelves.", "It\u2019s possible that foreign goods that are relabelled to make them appear as if they were made in Russia will be supplied\u201d, the expert added.", "Large retail chains will feel a negative effect from the introduction of quotas, especially those who find it advantageous to collaborate with importers.", "It is logical that, in a situation like this, foreign suppliers themselves will also suffer, since demand for their products will decrease.", "Litvinenko doesn\u2019t discount that the law on quotas could also have an impact on consumers.", "The fact is that some Russian-produced goods may be of a lower quality than their imported equivalents, and, as such, stores may jack up the price of the latter products, as if they were scarce commodities.", "Import substitution, an idea that had been forgotten about since the beginning of the 2000s, was once again being talked about by economists in February of this year, as a result of the relentless devaluation of the rouble.", "Now, against the backdrop of difficult relations with the West, the issue of renouncing imported goods is becoming ever more relevant.", "The law is intended to require retailers to reckon with domestic producers when placing orders with suppliers.", "In this way, we will be on the road to import substitution much more quickly and with greater confidence, and a system for planning the production of essential types of goods will be created in a shorter period of time\u201d, says Deputy Oleg Nilov.", "The quota mechanism will be especially effective for those agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly great, for example, in the dairy industry, where the share of imports amounted to 25%.", "Our farmers are entirely capable of wholly filling the shelves of Russian stores.", "More over, meat production could also receive a powerful boost.", "As is well known, beef maintains the highest import rate \u2013 from 30 to 35%.", "This means that 65-70% still comes from Russian output\u201d, Kasyanova reasons.", "Experts support the opinion that the introduction of quotas for domestic goods will contribute to import substitution and may accelerate the process.", "However, this one initiative on it\u2019s own will not give rise to import substitution, considering that a whole set of measures is needed for that, Litvinenko is certain.", "In any case, this initiative still allows for 50% of goods sold to be imported from abroad, and that means that wholesale import substitution will not take place, but a significant step in that direction will be accomplished.", "After all, it\u2019s not enough to establish quotas; we also need to get the production of domestic goods in this country back on track in order to fulfil those quotas.", "These quotas will in fact provide such guarantees\u201d, the

week, temperatures dropped again on Monday to a high of just 15.8C in the city.", "The squally conditions are believed to have contributed to the delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.", "The plane was scheduled to land just after 7.30pm but was hit by windshear - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and was forced to pull out.", "Wind gusts were reaching about 50km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at the time.", "Flight data showed the plane had to pull out of second landing and the plane eventually touched down about 8.40pm.", "That flight's delay caused the subsequent delay of a few other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Qantas flight from Sydney.", "A top of 16C is forecast for Adelaide on

control of issues related to price determination and regulation of the construction industry, as well as problems connecting to networks.", "An expert council on the development of competition in the sphere of construction has been created within the AMS.", "At a meeting, the Head of the Department for the Control of Housing and Public Utilities, Construction, and Natural Resources of the AMS, Vadim Solovev, stated that \u201cthe current method for calculating budgets for construction projects is absolutely incomprehensible\u201d.", "The regulatory framework makes the determination of prices non-transparent and could lead to unsubstantiated construction costs, the AMS reckons.", "They are suggesting that construction costs for government-owned facilities should be determined at the design stage on the basis of market prices for design concepts instead of the currently employed estimate standards and unit costs for operations.", "These proposals have been formulated as a \u201croad map\u201d, which is currently under consideration by the Ministry of Construction.", "\u201cThe replacement of traditional cost estimating documents in construction with calculations of structural components should lead to less corruption in the industry, Vadim Solovev explained to RGB.", "After all, right now every bolt and nut is calculated into the estimate, and it\u2019s not always possible to check it all, and, as such, every now and then, unethical construction companies can bury \u201ca whole tractor\u201d in the documents.", "The Ministry of Construction is in agreement with the AMS.", "\u201cThe first achievements in the transition to cost calculations of structural components are now ready: methodologies for calculating costs for design concepts and the budgeting process using these indicators have been developed\u201d, the Head of the Department for City Construction Activities and architect with the Ministry of Construction, Elena Zhukova, told RGB.", "The road construction industry has been chosen to pilot the project.", "However, experts consider that the problem is much more serious.", "As the Head of Profi-Invest construction company, Anatoly Demyanko, told RGB, the estimate norms have been out of date for quite some time, but no other mechanism has been offered to businesses thus far.", "\u201cAs for the proposed cost calculation of structural components, it will be difficult to implement in practise, since the construction of buildings often requires the use of totally different technologies\u201d, he declares.", "It\u2019s no secret that the construction industry is developing in large part thanks to state contracts.", "According to Ekaterina Lezina, Chair of the Board for the NPO, Expert Community of State Contract Professionals, right now, the state is the most solvent client.", "Vladimir Malakhov, Deputy Director of Engineering at the Industry Expertise Centre for Capital Projects at Rosatom, drew attention to the fact that today\u2019s market is basically divided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts, and those companies that possess a monopolistic area of expertise and refuse to let any competitors into that field.", "He believes that the creation of a transparent market is only possible under the condition that access to contracts will be fully protected from somebody else\u2019s control.", "At the Expert Council, it was proposed that the system of government orders be set up so that the same contractor would not be allowed to receive more than one contract valued at more than 1 bln. roubles or several contracts valued at more than 1 bln. roubles.", "The Ministry of Construction is under the impression that this approach needs to be evaluated from the perspective of its impact on business and the effectiveness of construction management.", "As Elena Zhukova explained, in a case like this, it would be necessary to entrust the client with the functions of the prime contractor, which would lead to an increased number of staff for the client, as well as an increase in budgetary expenditures to maintain them.", "Moreover, the client\u2019s specialists would have to possess the knowledge required to assess the quality of work completed by contracted organizations, as well as its safety.", "Oftentimes, with this type of set-up, it would be necessary to determine who will bear responsibility for the safety of the project as a whole.", "Furthermore, this approach might lead to an outflow of highly qualified personnel from state procurement contracts as a result of a lack of interest in receiving a state order for only part of a project and a low value contract.", "Deputy Head of the expert-consulting centre, Public Procurement Institute, Aleksandr Yevstashenkov, believes that, right now, the procedure for state contracts has turned into a professional test of a contractor\u2019s attention to detail.", "He offered the following example: \u201cupon filling-out an application for tender, a participant must provide \u2018concrete indicators\u2019 without using the words: \u2018or equivalent\u2019, \u2018should be\u2019, \u2018up to\u2019, \u2018more than\u2019, \u2018less than\u2019, \u2018analogue\u2019, \u2018or\u2019, \u2018a type\u2019, \u2018a similar type\u2019, \u2018not lower than\u2019, \u2018lower than\u2019, \u2018higher than\u2019, \u2018may\u2019, \u2018may have\u2019, \u2018may be\u2019, \u2018earlier\u2019, \u2018not earlier\u2019, \u2018not higher than\u2019, \u2018not permitted\u2019, and so forth.", "In this way, clients often abuse their right to establish the content requirements for the application given to contracting organizations.", "Another problem with Federal Law 44, according to Yevstashenkov, was the requirement to once again assess the quality of work at the application submission stage through a \u201cpaper\u201d proposal by the participant.", "But in considering a participant\u2019s application, it is really only possible to assess the contractor\u2019s qualifications, and not the quality of work, which hasn\u2019t even commenced yet, the expert reckons.", "The quality of work can only be assessed once it has been completed.", "At the Expert Council, it was also suggested that marginal revenue be transferred from the upper to the lower echelon in order to remove interim contractors.", "The Chair of the Expert Council, Official Secretary, and Deputy Director of AMS, Andrei Tsarikovsky, believes that this shouldn\u2019t be done, because the general contractor should be in-charge of the project.", "Otherwise, it will turn out like the line from the famous satirical skit by Arkady Raikin, \u201cAt the

trading session, the MICEX index fell by 1.67%, but the RTS lost 3.27%.", "Such a significant difference in the relative magnitude of decline in the indices is explained by the weakening of the rouble by more than 1.5% over the course of the day.", "The weakening of the rouble has an emotional element to it, which explains the widespread rush to buy foreign currency.", "Experience shows that emotions will slowly fade away and the rouble\u2019s listed price will either partly or fully recover its losses.", "\u201cWe suspect that, before long, we will see a ratio between the dollar and the

deposit insurance system, and they are cheaper for a bank to offer since it doesn\u2019t have to contribute funds to the Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA).", "The poignancy of the situation is that plans to take this step were made as a result of small and medium-size banks distributing these certificates, but it is Sberbank and Bank of Moscow, which according to DIA estimates control 98% of the niche market, that will suffer as a result.", "Moreover, Bank of Moscow\u2019s share, according to the agency\u2019s estimates, amounts to around 3.5%.", "The issue, the DIA explains, is that clients of a small bank who have purchased this certificate might try to get money from the DIA in a case where the bank\u2019s license is revoked.", "Some investors don\u2019t have a sufficient level of financial understanding and, when purchasing bearer savings certificates, may assume that their investments are insured.", "The legitimate absence of insurance compensation for such certificates, in a case where a bank\u2019s licence is revoked, might lead to misunderstanding and social unrest.", "The agency has dealt with actual situations where the holders of bearer certificates have attempted to collect insurance compensation through the courts\u201d, the DIA stated.", "The problem, of course, is far-fetched.", "After all, no one will ever pay the buyers of such certificates since they don\u2019t have any rights under the law to seek compensation from the state.", "If the issue was that the instrument isn\u2019t insured by the DIA, then they also would have banned metal accounts, in which citizens\u2019 wealth is recorded according to grams of one of four metals: gold, silver, platinum, and palladium.", "After all, these accounts also are not covered by the deposit insurance system, but so far no one is trying to snuff them out.", "Most likely, the issue is that these bearer certificates are a very convenient valuable security, which can basically be used as quasi-money.", "Moreover, their movement is almost uncontrollable: any client of a bank can buy the certificate and hand it over to any other citizen, and, until it is converted into cash, this certificate can change hands between a multitude of owners.", "It is no accident that the wording of the draft bill requires that a savings certificate be a registered security that is held at a depository institution.", "But, in order to sweeten the deal for the banks, these certificates can be issued without the right to early redemption.", "In other words, bankers will finally get an

them, simply ratcheted up the process.", "On the one hand, Minsk succeeded in keeping its relations with Ukraine rather warm, so as to not significantly hurt mutual trade, and President Poroshenko was able to come to Belarus for the negotiations.", "On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure didn\u2019t recognize Crimea\u2019s unification with Russia and called for the pro-Russian rebels

"The fly in the ointment for Minsk turned out to be a statement by President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that European Union representatives, it turns out, personally asked him about this.", "Nevertheless, in the final briefing, Aleksandr Lukashenko made it clear that all sides are not opposed to having Minsk remain as the main forum for meetings in the Russia-OSCE-Ukraine format,

at the meeting, which will deal with the supply of gas and overcoming the misgivings of CU countries regarding Ukraine\u2019s association agreement with the EU, appears to be a much grander achievement than the peaceful declarations lacking concrete dates and numbers.", "Commissioner for Trade, Karel De Gucht, nevertheless, indicated that EU representatives \u201ccame to Minsk to find a

Belarus, using Ukrainian raw materials, which is intended for the Russian market.", "Ukrainian producers do about 4 bln. dollars in exports to Russia, and Belarusian production and trading structures could now turn out to be in very high-demand\u201d.", "According to Romanchuk, the role of forum host to negotiations between the EU and the CU is ideal for Lukashenko, as well as in terms of developing economic relations with Europe.", "He reminds us that losses to the EU\u2019s agricultural sector, as a result of Moscow\u2019s sanctions, are valued at between 5-10 bln. euros, and that the European Commission has, as of late, only offered agrarians 125 mln. euros in compensation.", "The Belarusian President could offer Brussels the opportunity to work together to minimize the impact on European farmers.", "This could raise Lukashenko\u2019s profile in the EU to an unprecedented level.", "Hospitality without initiative", "Catherine Ashton thanked Belarusian authorities for their initiative to hold a summit.", "But the paradox is that official Minsk denies its active role in creating the CU+EU format, and the Belarusian leader, at a meeting with his Ukrainian colleague,

clout.", "The Belarusian diplomatic agency assiduously stresses that Belarus does not have ulterior motives in organizing cooperation between the EU and the CU on its soil, given that the final goal of such a format is the creation, in the future, of a unified trading area from Lisbon to Vladivostok.", "\u201cThis is absolutely in keeping with policies in other fields, including in the field of
