Sunday for the Ukrainian government to stop the fight against separatists in the east of the country and to immediately open negotiations on the national sovereignty of the isolated areas.", "His spokesperson Dmitry Peskov later explained that Putin had no intention of implying that the regions of eastern Ukraine under the control of separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be re-evaluated so that the Russian-speaking region would be empowered to protect its rights and interests.", "Putin's call to the Kiev government to treat pro-Russian insurgents as equals corresponds to a clear strategy that follows from the outbreak of unrest five months ago: Help the separatists occupy the territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly announced Novoruska effective independence so that instead of the West can join Russia.", "In an interview for the first channel of state television Putin condemned Ukrainian military actions to reclaim the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which in March and April were dominated by separatists after Moscow's annexation of the Crimean Peninsula belonging to Ukraine on 18 March.", "The Kremlin and Separatists have recently designated the territory as a \"New Russia\" or a \"New Russia,\" a term that refers to the famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian empire.", "The Russian press agency Itar-Tass has published Putin's words saying that the prison is an illusion about anyone who believes peace negotiations are on the horizon because Ukrainian politicians launched

areas, we must immediately start meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organisation of society and on the status of the state sovereignty of the south-east of Ukraine.", "Peskov said that Putin's reference to state sovereignty was meant in the context of broader autonomy, which has been discussed with Kiev's leadership for several months and which is intended to alleviate the concerns of Russian-speaking areas from the threat of cultural and linguistic rights.", "Peskov said that only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions.", "This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict.", "The intervention of the spokesman of the Kremlin, who was to correct the incorrect interpretation of Putin's remarks, highlighted Russia's leadership's approach to addressing the uprising of the separatists in the east, which is different from the open cast of Crimea, where most of the two-million-dollar population of origin belongs to ethnic Russians.", "Moscow would have much more difficulty anecting Donetsk and Luhansk in the east of Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million people are not Russians, and public opinion polls that have taken place before the conflict have shown broad support for remaining in Ukraine.", "The autonomy discussed by Russian diplomats in international fora would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, and thus essentially give the Kremlin effective control over the territory that would link the Russian mainland with Crimea.", "The Black Sea Peninsula, annexed five months ago, is the headquarters of the main Russian naval fleet, maritime business facilities and historical coastal resorts.", "The areas between Russia's Rostov and Crimea are also a centre of mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian army.", "During his inauguration speech of June 7, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested that Ukrainian legislators - after the new elections - consider changes in the constitution that would give different regions more control over their finances and language status.", "But this vision of autonomy differs greatly from that of the Kremlin and separatists, and Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.", "Putin's last call for Kiev to treat separatists as equals was followed by further insurgents last week after Russian troops and tanks from a previously quiet area along the Azov Sea penetrated eastern Ukraine.", "The separatists reinforced by the Russians took control of Novoazovsk

counters.", "However, the initiative can have both positive and negative effects, experts say.", "According to the counsel of Taxic, a member of Sergei Litvinenko, the independent expert centre

to break into the counters of local shops because of high competition from foreign counterparts.", "Now that the embargo has been imposed, this niche has been freed and can breathe with relief.", "But

now a time of calm when the previous players have already left and the new players have not yet arrived.", "Nearly a month later, we can talk about the increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as the rise in the prices of finished products,\" said Aife.ru, First Vice-President of the Russian public organization Rossian Club of Financial Directors, K.E. Tamara Kasyanova.", "Clearly, the idea of selling at least 50 per cent of Russian food products in each category will make it possible to secure the sector to local producers.", "In that case, they would compete with each other rather than with goods that were less expensive with subsidies from another State.", "In other words, the competition for the buyer will take place between companies operating under the same laws of the industry.", "On the other hand, Kasyanova points out that Russian producers are not able to meet 50 per cent of the domestic needs of compatriots in all respects.", "And in this situation, trading networks will have to push Russia's share of goods to half the range.", "As a result, there is a growing fear that poor goods will reach the counters.", "It is possible that foreign products with broken labels will be supplied as produced in Russia,\" the expert adds.", "The negative effects of quotas will be felt by large trading networks, especially those that benefit more from cooperation with importers.", "It is logical that foreign suppliers themselves will suffer from this situation, as the demand for their products will decrease.", "Litvinenko does not rule out that the law on quotas for domestic goods may affect consumers as well.", "The point is that some Russian-made products may be of less quality than imported counterparts, while shops may be able to raise the prices of the second as scarce goods.", "The idea of import substitution, forgotten in the early 2000s, was again discussed by economists in February this year because of the continuous devaluation of the ruble.", "Now, against the backdrop of a difficult relationship with the West, the question of giving up imported products becomes even more urgent.", "The Act is intended to require Riteilers to treat domestic producers when making orders to suppliers.", "Then we will go much faster and more confident on the way to import, and the production planning system for the necessary products will be set up in a shorter time frame,\" says Deputy Oleg Nealov.", "A particularly effective quota mechanism would be for those agricultural sectors where the potential was particularly high, for example in the dairy sector, where the share of imports was 25 per cent.", "Our farmers are really capable of fully covering the counters of Russian shops.", "In addition, meat production can also gain a strong boost.", "As is known, the largest share of imports remains for beef, ranging from 30 per cent to 35 per cent.", "So 65 to 70 percent is still Russian,\" Kasyanova says.", "Experts were of the view that the introduction of quotas on domestic products would facilitate and could accelerate import substitution.", "However, this initiative alone will not lead to import substitution, as it requires a set of measures, I am sure of Litvinenko.", "In any case, 50 per cent of the goods sold under the initiative could still be imported from abroad, which meant that full import would not occur, but significant steps would be taken in that direction.", "Moreover, there were few quotas, and domestic production had yet to be established in order to meet those quotas.", "These quotas will provide such guarantees,\" the expert notes.", "Untimed diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment means that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more",

\"less\", \"analogue\", \"or\", \"type\", \"same\", \"not below\", \"above\", \"may\", \"may\", \"may\", \"be\", \"not previously\", \"not above\", \"not permitted\", etc.", "Thus, employers often abuse their right to establish requirements for the content of an application submitted by a contracting organization.", "Another 44-FZ problem, in the view of Eustashenka, was the need to evaluate the quality of the work through the participant's paper offer as early as the application stage.", "When considering a participant's application, it is only possible to assess the contractor's qualifications, but not the quality of the work that has not yet been undertaken, the expert believes.", "The quality of the work can only be assessed when it is accepted.", "The expert board was also

muscles involved in its creation is not random, but an additional means of expressing power and threat, learned by scientists from Australia and the United States.", "They reported on their findings in the magazine Evolution and Human Behavior, and they can be read briefly in a press release from the University of California in Santa Barbara.", "The angry expression of faces - moved and down the eyebrows, drawn lips in the thin line, puffed nostrils - is the same in all cultures, and even blind children who have never seen it are making it, as noted by Aaron Sell, the lead author of the study.", "As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists have learned that this emotion has emerged to deal effectively with disputes during the conflict.", "The more physical damage one person can cause to another, the more he can dictate his conditions, and he communicates it with anger.", "Researchers have also found evidence of their own hypothesis: physically strong people are more likely to be angry and to resort to manual use, feel free to impose conditions upon others that do not benefit them, and prefer to use force to resolve conflicts peacefully.", "In response to the fact that anger is first and foremost an \"emotion of trade\", scientists have decided that the movements of each of the seven muscle groups, which create an angry face, should present the angry individual with a stronger and more dangerous face - and thus force him/her to accept his/her terms as soon as possible in order to avoid conflict.", "To test this hypothesis, researchers modelled on the computer the faces where each of the seven elements of the angry face was present or missing and showed them to informers.", "Although the downed eyebrows or the forward chin alone did not make the face angry, the more physically powerful person in the study was unanimously recognized.", "The anger of man, like that of animals, poses a threat: an exaggerated act of self - strength that compels consent and submission.", "A man blows up nostrils and presses his lips for the same purpose as a frog who blows up, or a grandmother who shows his fangs.", "\"The anger \"begins\" the respondent's refusal to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes a form that shows the opposite side as effectively as possible the consequences of the refusal.", "But the most striking thing is that none of the components of the angry face is arbitrary, all of them expressing the same thing,\" noted Anthropologist John Toubi.", "The Ministry of Communications has proposed 250
