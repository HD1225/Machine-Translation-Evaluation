that in the case of searching for a unified physics theory it is not a boring story.", "The fundamental physics problem between the two key theories (although at the moment our universe is de facto

distance, you can easily see a long horizontally stretched hose, but if you do not suffer from sharpness, the thickness of the hose is difficult to recognize.", "Given its large distance from the

structure.", "The question immediately arises as to how Kaluza's observation fits together with the obvious fact that we see three dimensions of space.", "The answer which Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and which was clearly expressed and specified by the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the assertion that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and dirty dimensions.", "This means that, like the dimensions of the length of the hose, our universe also has three large, wide-ranging and easily visible dimensions whose existence we are aware of at every moment.", "But, analogously to the circular circumference of a garden hose, the universe may have additional dimensions, firmly plunged into space so small that they have hitherto

see a new, circle-shaped, lead dimension, similar to the thread loops in a densely woven piece of carpet.", "Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circular dimension existed at every point in the direction of large dimensions, just as a hose has a circular circumference at every point of its length.", "For the sake of clarity, we only extended the circular dimension to some regularly located points.", "Figure 4 summarizes Kaluza and Klein's idea of the microscopic structure of space geometry.", "The similarity with the hose is obvious, although we note important differences.", "First, the universe has three large, far-reaching spatial dimensions (of which we have drawn only two), whereas the hose has only one large dimension.", "Even more importantly, the difference is that we're talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just some object inside the universe, like our hose.", "But the basic idea is the same.", "If the additional circular lead dimension is extremely miniature, it is much harder to recognize it - as is the circular circumference of the hose - than to observe the obvious, large, and wide-ranging dimensions.", "If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will in fact be revealed beyond the power of our most modern enlargement tools.", "Most importantly, however, the extra dimensions are not just a huge bubble within the normal dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration misleadingly suggests.", "A circle dimension is a new dimension that exists in each point of three common wide dimensions.", "It is an independent dimension on the remaining three dimensions, just as the top-down, left-right and front-back dimensions are independent (and triangular) of each other.", "A sufficiently small ant could move in all four dimensions, and to determine its position we would need four data, except for the three usual positions in the circular dimension; if we also count time,

tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.", "If the state continues to meet its income targets next year, this law could reduce the state\u2019s corporate income tax rate to 3 percent by 2017.", "Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better and are therefore paying more state and

the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.", "However, Putin\u2019s call to the Kiev government to negotiate at the highest level with the pro-Russian insurgents fits

the direct annexation of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.", "Moscow would have much greater difficulty in annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls from the period before the conflict gave a broad majority for remaining in Ukraine.", "The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats in international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, thus giving the Kremlin de facto control

clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled region of eastern Ukraine should become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to give the Russian-speaking population the power to defend their own rights and interests.", "Putin's call for the government of Kiev to negotiate with the Russian insurgents as equal negotiating partners is in line with his obvious strategy, which he has pursued since the violence began five years ago: he is trying to help the separatists to take over the region, thereby forcing the Ukrainian Government in practice to grant the recently declared independence of Novorossiysk, which will enable it to turn to Russia instead of to the West.", "In an interview with the State Channel 1, Putin condemned the attempts of the Ukrainian army to regain the separatist-controlled areas of eastern Donetsk and Luhansk, which were occupied by the separatists on March and April following Moscow's annexation of the Crimean Peninsula on 18 March.", "The Kremlin and the separatists have recently turned the region into a \u2018Novorossiy\u2019, a \u2018new Russia\u2019 \u2013 a term reminiscent of the days before the revolutions of the Russian empire.", "According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said that the planned peace negotiations would be 'an illusion' as long as Ukrainian politicians

issues, but also on the organisation of society and the status of the state of South-East Ukraine, taking into account the interests of the people living there,\" he says.", "According to Peskov, Putin's reference to'statehood' is linked to broader independence, which has been discussed for months with the Kiev leadership in its attempt to allay the fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.", "Only the Ukrainian Government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need, says Peskov.", "There can be no debate between Ukraine and Russia on this issue, Mr Peskov says, 'because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine'.", "An interim remark by the Kremlin representative aimed at correcting the'misinterpretation' of Putin's comments highlighted the fact that the Russian regime treats the separatist insurgency in the eastern regions differently from that in Crimea, thereby effectively occupying an area with an ethnic Russian majority of a population of 2 million people.", "It would be far more difficult for Moscow to connect itself to the Donetsk or Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, even though the majority of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnic Russians and, according to pre-conflict opinion polls, the majority of the population favoured staying in Ukraine.", "The independence discussed by Russian diplomats in international forums would give the Ukrainian local governments the right to agree on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give the Kremlin practical powers in an area linking Russia to Crimea.", "The Black Sea Peninsula, which joined Russia five months ago, is home to the Russian main fleet, as well as commercial maritime ports and historical coastal sites.", "There are also mines, factories and metal smelters in the region between Russia's Rostov and Crimea, which produce products vital to

writes.", "The document will be further elaborated to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.", "This applies to goods that are not produced in Russia. <...> For the other groups of products that are produced in Russia, the retailer will have to provide at least half of its sites to domestic producers,\" Nilov told the publication.", "Together with the amendments to the article \"On the basis of the state regulation of trade activity in the Russian Federation\" the bill provides for amendments to the Tax Code, establishing a reduced VAT rate of 10% on the sale of products produced in Russia.", "The idea of introducing a 50% quota in trade networks is part of a package of incentive measures for Russian producers.", "There will be several times more domestic goods on the shelves.", "However, the initiative can have both a positive and a negative effect, experts say.", "According to lawyer of the company \"Nalovik\", member of the independent expert center \"Public Duma\" Sergey Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive and will lead to growth.", "Farmers, farmers and small shops will benefit.", "They will be able to sell more, which means that profits will increase.", "In addition, they will have the right to dictate to retailers their terms and prices, because they will be forced to buy their goods.", "Russian producers will be able to increase the volume of their activities and sales, which will lead to higher taxes than before.", "This will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, some industries will expand, some will learn faster, and contribute to GDP growth.", "Russia\u2019s dependence on foreign food will decrease several times, but not immediately,\u201d the

embargo, this niche has been liberated and you can breathe comfortably.", "But it should not be forgotten that after all necessary agreements and sanitary inspections, food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will enter the Russian market.", "In other words, now there is a \"moment of silence\" when the former players have already left and the new ones have not yet come.",

the general Russian public organization \"Russian Club of Financial Directors\", k.e.n. Tamara Kasyanova.", "Clearly, the idea of selling at least 50% of Russian food products in each category will enable the sector to catch up with local producers.", "In this case, they will compete with each other, not with goods that are cheaper at the expense of subsidies from another state.", "In other words, the struggle for the buyer will spread between companies operating under the common laws of the industry.", "On the other hand, Kasyanova notes, Russian producers are able to meet 50% of domestic needs of citizens by far not all articles.", "And in this situation, trade networks will have to \"delay\" the share of Russian goods to half the assortment.", "As a result, there are growing fears that poor quality goods will arrive at the entrances.", "It is possible that foreign products with overwritten labels will be supplied in the form of products produced in Russia,\" the expert adds.", "The negative effect of introducing quotas will be felt by large trading networks, especially those that prefer to cooperate with importers.", "It is logical that foreign suppliers will also benefit from such a deployment, as demand for their products will decrease.", "Litvinenko does not rule out that the law on quotas for domestic goods can also affect consumers.", "The fact is that some products of Russian production may be inferior in quality to imported analogues, while shops will be able to price the second as a scarce commodity.", "The idea of import substitution, which was forgotten in the early 2000s, was revived by economists in February of this year due to the continuous devaluation of the ruble.", "Now, against the backdrop of difficult relations with the West, the question of refusing to import products becomes even more urgent.", "The law is designed to oblige retailers to treat suppliers as domestic producers when forming orders.", "Then we will go much faster and more confident on the way of import substitution, and the system of production planning for the necessary types of products will be created in a shorter time,\" deputy Oleg Nilov says.", "Particularly effective quota mechanism will be for those agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly high, for example, in the dairy sector, where the share of imports was 25%.", "Our farmers are really able to fully cover the entrances of Russian shops.", "Furthermore, meat production can get a powerful impulse.", "As is known, the largest share of imports remains on beef - from 30% to 35%.", "It turns out, 65-70% are still accounted for by Russian products\", - Kasyanova argues.", "Experts are of the opinion that introduction of quotas for domestic products will facilitate import substitution and may accelerate this process.", "However, in itself, this initiative will not lead to import substitution, as it requires a complex of measures, Litvinenko is sure.", "In any case, 50% of the goods sold under this initiative can still be imported from abroad, which means that there will be no full import substitution, but significant steps will be taken in this direction.", "In addition, it is not enough to set quotas, it is still necessary to set up domestic production in the country in order to meet these quotas.", "These quotas will provide just such guarantees,\" the expert states.", "Untimely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal

interests.", "But Putin\u2019s call to the Kiev government to start negotiations with the pro-Russian rebels as equals was in line with the obvious strategy he has followed since the bloodshed began five months ago: Help the separatists take the territory and force the Ukrainian government to give the newly proclaimed territory of New Russia real independence in order to come closer to Russia, not the West.", "In an interview with the state's First TV channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for the return of separatist-held territory in the eastern Donetsk and Lugansk regions, which were captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.", "The Kremlin and separatists have recently named the occupied territories New Russia, or New Russia, a name that refers to the pre-revolutionary days of glory of the Russian Empire.", "Putin said that anyone who believes that peaceful negotiations will take place in the near future, when Ukrainian politicians start campaigns for the 26 October parliamentary elections and while government troops attack peaceful settlements in regions held by separatists, is a \"prisoner of illusions\", ITAR-TASS reported.", "\"We must immediately start meaningful negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and state status of south-eastern Ukraine, in order to respect the interests of the people living there,\" he said.", "Peskov said Putin's words about statehood were in the context of broader autonomy, which was discussed during months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm fears in Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights were in danger.", "Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.", "It is not a question for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, \"because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict.\"", "The intervention of the Kremlin's press secretary to correct Putin's \"false interpretation\" of the words underscored the Russian leadership's decision to treat the separatist uprising in the east in a different way than the open seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million people are ethnic Russians.", "Moscow would have to endure a much more difficult battle to join even the Donetsk and Lugansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians, and polls prior to the conflict showed broad support for the desire to remain inside Ukraine.", "The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, in fact, transferring to the Kremlin actual control over territory that would connect Russia\u2019s main territory with Crimea.", "The Black Sea Peninsula, joined five months ago, is home to the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historical maritime resorts.", "In the regions between the Russian Rostov region and Crimea there are also mines, factories and iron works that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.", "Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed during his inauguration speech on 7 June that Ukrainian legislators after the new elections should weigh constitutional amendments allowing to give the separated regions greater control over their finances and the status of languages.", "However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from that of the Kremlin and separatist insurgents, accused of arming and instigating Moscow.", "Putin\u2019s latest call to Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders as equals followed renewed rebel attacks last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area along the Azov Sea.", "Supported by Russia, the separatists took control of the city of Novoazovsk in an attack, which Ukrainian security officials say they fear is the beginning of a campaign to seize strategic coastal territory to the Crimea itself.", "This resulted in large-scale civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants, which is located between Novoazovsky and a narrow passage to the Crimean Peninsula.", "Poroshenko addressed a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels on Saturday to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet republic, which has been independent for 23 years.", "\"We are approaching the point of irreversible,\" Poroshenko warned.", "Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.",

has arisen for effective dispute resolution during conflict.", "The more physical damage one person can cause to another, the more he has the ability to dictate his conditions, and he brings it to the interlocutor with the help of anger.", "The researchers found confirmations of another hypothesis: physically strong people are more likely to be angry and switch to manuals, consider themselves entitled to impose unfavourable conditions on others, and prefer violent methods of peaceful conflict resolution.", "Reflecting on the fact that anger is primarily a \"trading emotion,\" the scientists decided that the movements of each of the seven muscle groups that create the angry expression of the face should make the angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor - and thus force him to agree with his conditions as soon as possible in order to avoid conflict.", "To test this hypothesis, researchers modeled the face on a computer, where each of the
